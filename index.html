        I am 24 years old. Last year, I worked as an engine cadet for Starlite
        Ferries Incoporated for 1 year and 2 days. As an engine cadet, I was
        responsible for familiarizing myself with the ship's operation,
        particularly the engine room, and learning how to operate and
        maintenance of all the machineries. One of my daily tasks is to keep
        watch before and after duty, as well as to read and log all of the
        gauges and paramiters.

        I am able to operate the main engines, auxiliary engines, as well as the

        for me to familiarize with the ship's operations.
