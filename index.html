            I am 24 years old. Last year, I worked as an engine cadet for
            Starlite Ferries Incoporated for 1 year and 2 days. As an engine
            cadet, I was responsible for familiarizing myself with the ship's
            operation, particularly the engine room, and learning how to operate
            and maintenance of all the machineries. One of my daily tasks is to
            keep watch before and after duty, as well as to read and log all of
            the gauges and paramiters.

    <h2>My strenghts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          I am able to operate the main engines, auxiliary engines, as well as
          the ballasting and bunkering operation. I'm confident that it is not
          hard for me to familiarize with the ship's operations.

    <h2>My weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Actually I dont consider any of my traits as my weaknesses, I see it
          as a opportunity to grow and improve, and I believe everything is a
          learning experience.
