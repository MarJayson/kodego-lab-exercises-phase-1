    <b>
      I am 24 years old. Last year, I worked as
      an engine cadet for Starlite Ferries Incoporated for 1 year and 2 days. As
      an engine cadet, I was responsible for familiarizing myself with the
      ship's operation, particularly the engine room, and learning how to operate
      and maintenance of all the machineries. One of my daily tasks is to keep
      watch before and after duty, as well as to read and log all of the gauges
      and paramiters.
